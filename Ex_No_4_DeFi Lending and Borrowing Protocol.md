# Experiment 4: DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol

# Aim:
To build a decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest and borrow assets by providing collateral. This experiment introduces concepts like overcollateralization, liquidity pools, and interest accrual in DeFi.

# Algorithm:
Step 1: Setup Lending and Borrowing Mechanism
Users deposit ETH into the contract as liquidity.

Step 2: 
Depositors receive interest based on their deposits.

Step 3: 
Borrowers can borrow ETH but must provide collateral (e.g., 150% of the borrowed amount).

Step 4: 
Interest on borrowed funds is calculated dynamically based on utilization rate.


Step 5: Implement Overcollateralization
If a borrowerâ€™s collateral value drops below a certain liquidation threshold, their collateral is liquidated to repay the debt.


Step 6: Allow Liquidation
If collateral < liquidation threshold, liquidators can repay the borrower's debt and claim their collateral at a discount.

Users can borrow ETH by providing collateral.

If collateral < 150% of borrowed amount, liquidators can seize the collateral.

# High-Level Overview:
Teaches key DeFi concepts: lending, borrowing, collateral, liquidation.
Introduces risk management: overcollateralization and liquidation.
Directly related to DeFi protocols like Aave and Compound.

# RESULT : 

Thus,DeFi Lending and Borrowing Protocol has been created and successfully executed.
